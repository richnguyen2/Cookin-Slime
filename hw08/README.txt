The program is a game called, Cookin Slime, where the player plays as a slime and
to fullfill orders given at the top of the screen. You can pick up and place down ingredients, 
chop meat, cook meat, and burn meat as well. After creating the order, it should be placed to the table
on the right of the screen to get your money.
The controls to move are the arrow keys.
The key to pick up/place down items is Z. You can pick up items from the ingredient tables on the left, and place them
down on the tables in the middle. Uncooked meat can be placed on the cutting board to be chopped up.
The key X can be used to cut meat if the meat is put on the cutting board, and
it can also cook the meat if the meat is put on the stove. Be careful, the meat can be overcooked and will be burnt.
